## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to design and implement a churn prediction and retention system for a company. The solution includes:

- **Churn Prediction Models**: Analyze customer data to predict churn and identify contributing factors.
- **NLP for Customer Feedback Analysis**: Analyze textual feedback to understand customer dissatisfaction.
- **Generative AI for Retention**: Develop personalized retention strategies to reduce churn.

## Data Understanding & Preprocessing

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Handling Missing Values**: Utilize imputation techniques for numerical and categorical data.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Identify and treat outliers using box plots and z-scores.
- **Data Transformation**: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conducted to uncover insights, such as the correlation between features and churn.

## Predictive Models for Churn Analysis

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification, estimating the probability of churn based on customer features.

### Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that improves accuracy and handles non-linear relationships effectively.

- **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into which factors most influence churn predictions.

## NLP for Customer Feedback Analysis

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess customer sentiment from feedback using VADER's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
- **Outcome**: Summary metrics and insights into customer satisfaction.

### Topic Modeling
- **Method**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to extract common themes from customer feedback.

## Generative AI for Retention Strategies

- **Customized Strategies**: Develop tailored communication plans based on customer profiles and feedback using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## System Integration & Deployment

### Architecture
Integrate predictive modeling, NLP analysis, and generative AI into a unified system.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Utilize AWS or Azure for scalable deployment.

### Real-Time Data Processing
Implement data streaming solutions for real-time data ingestion and model updates.
